# The Significance of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript

TypeScript is a powerful language that brings static typing to JavaScript. One of the most useful features that TypeScript offers is its advanced type system, which includes _union types_ and _intersection types_. These types allow you to create flexible, yet type-safe code that can adapt to various scenarios. In this blog post, we'll dive into the significance of these types, how they work, and when you might use them, with simple code examples to help clarify the concepts.

## What are Union Types?

A **union type** allows a variable to hold values of multiple types. In other words, you can specify that a value could be one type or another, and TypeScript will enforce that.

### Example:

```typescript
let value: string | number;

value = "Hello, TypeScript!"; // valid
value = 42; // valid
value = true; // error: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string | number'
```

# Union Types vs Intersection Types in TypeScript

## Union Types

Union types are especially useful when you want a function to accept multiple types of input or a variable to be flexible but type-safe.

### Example of Union Types in Functions:

```typescript
function printId(id: string | number) {
	console.log(`Your ID is: ${id}`);
}

printId(101); // works fine
printId("ABC123"); // works fine
printId(true); // error: Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string | number'.
```

## Intersection Types

An intersection type allows you to combine multiple types into one. It means that a value must satisfy all the types included in the intersection. It's like saying, "This value must be both A and B at the same time."

### Example of Intersection Types:

```typescript
type Employee = {
	name: string;
	role: string;
};

type Manager = Employee & {
	department: string;
};

const manager: Manager = {
	name: "Alice",
	role: "Manager",
	department: "Sales",
};
```

In the above example, `manager` must be both an `Employee` and a `Manager` at the same time.

## When to Use Union Types?

When you need a variable to hold values of different types, use a union type. It's like saying, "This value can be either A or B."

## When to Use Intersection Types?

When you need a variable to hold values that are both A and B at the same time, use an intersection type. It's like saying, "This value must be both A and B at the same time."
